# Bullet's Hell Design Doc
## Overview
Bullet's Hell is a top down 2D game in which the avatar is a bullet. The goal of the game is to connect with the target. The path to the target will be impeded by various obstacles. Each obstacle will have a different impact on the avatar. There will also be power ups on the path to the target. These power ups will have different impacts on the avatar as well. The bullet will slowly lose speed over time as the avatar travels towards the target. The player beats the level if the bullet is able to connect with the target. The player loses the level if the avatar runs out of speed or is stopped by an obstacle. (we could also incorporate some type of currency that can be collected during gameplay. This currency could be then used for cosmetic upgrades to the bullet etc.)
